# Alloy

The recipe: [Iron Ingot](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Iron_ingot) and [Gold Nugget](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Gold_nugget).

<table>
<tr><td>Gold Nugget</td><td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Iron Ingot</td><td></td></tr>
</table>

This creates an alloy, which looks like an enchanted diamond.

* You can craft things with alloy, instead of diamond. It's exactly same to diamond.
* The only exception is that you cannot craft [Diamond Block](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Diamond_block) with it.
