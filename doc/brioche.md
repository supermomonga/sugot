# Brioche

The recipe

<table>
<tr><td>Egg</td></td></tr>
<tr><td>Bread</td></td></tr>
</table>

This creates a brioche, which looks like an enchanted bread.

* Same food supply as [Bread](http://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Bread)
* You get some extra EXP
    * But this EXP does not raise your level by itself.
